# Linear-Regression-2
This project involves developing a linear regression model to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on physiological parameters such as Glucose, BloodPressure, BMI, Insulin level, and Age. The project includes the implementation of two linear regression models: one using the closed-form solution and the other using gradient descent. The goal is to evaluate the models' performance in terms of classification accuracy.
